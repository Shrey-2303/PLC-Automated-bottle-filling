# PLC-Automated-bottle-filling
This Repository includes the final project for the course Programmable logic controller as well as all the prior lab logics during the course duration.

The final project included writing ladder logic and structured text for a fully automated bottle fiulling system capable of identifying broken, partially filled and completely filled bottles during the process. The logic used simple P-control to regulate the liquid flow in the tanks and bottles.
