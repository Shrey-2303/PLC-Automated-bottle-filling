# PLC-Automated-bottle-filling
This Repository includes the final project for the course Programmable logic controller as well as all the prior lab logics during the course duration.

The final project included writing ladder logic and structured text for a fully automated bottle fiulling system capable of identifying broken, partially filled and completely filled bottles during the process. The logic used simple P-control to regulate the liquid flow in the tanks and bottles.

1) The first directory has the files and the final report for the course project. the software used throughout the course is TwinCAT 2.7 for simulation as well as writing the logic

2)  The second directory houses all the prior lab files along with description of each logic used in the individual labs.
